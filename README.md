## Overview and Origin

Ripple is a company that uses blockchain technology and cryptocurrency (XRP) to process 
international payments in a much easier and efficient manner. It was first thought of by Jeb McCaleb 
and built by Arthur Britto and David Schwartz (current Cheif Technology Officer) in 2005. 
It was then released in 2012 and by 2013 they claimed that many banks were interested in the project. 
Currently over 300 financial instituitions are using RippleNet, including Bank of America, 
Satander Bank, and American Express. 
They have had $150 million plus donations since 2018. 
They also have investors from capital firms and strategic investors.
However, many people argue that their main source of income comes from the XRP token, since ripple owns
about 50% of the cryptocurrency XRP.



## Business Activities:

Ripple is trying to solve a major problem in the space of finance right now. International payments
currently are very slow and costly. Most payments go through SWIFT, a messaging network used by banks
to transfer information, such as money transfer instructions. 
Payments that go through SWIFT often have to go through multiple banks because of the many different 
currencies involved. 
For example, if buisness A wants to send YEN to buisness B, which uses
Mexican PESOS, the YEN will have to be converted through multiple banks in search of currency conversions 
(because most likely buisness A with YEN does not have Mexican PESOS and vice verse)  
which costs money in fees and time.
These payments also take several days to settle, which means more time wasted and if the payments 
are not settled for whatever reason, they can be reversed or cancelled. 

Ripple offers to solved this problem with their RippleNet protocol and their cryptocurrency XRP. RippleNet 
allows banks to transfer information much quicker and cheaper than SWIFT. They also allow banks
to issue IOU's to each other. An IOU is simply a debt that one bank owes to another. However, the real 
magic happens with the XRP token. With XRP, banks can now transfer value and settle transactions in real
time and at very low costs, as opposed to SWIFT which can take days to settle transactions and is very 
costly. XRP can process over 1000 transactions per second and only costing fractions of a penny, as 
compared to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which can only process about 8 tranactions per second and ETH which can only process
about 16 per second (currently ETH fees are ridiculous, some transactions costing over $100 in fees!). 
This makes XRP one of the fastest and cheapest to use tokens in the cryptocurrency market, also making
it the most optimal for the specific use case of transferring payments.
With the XRP token, banks can simply convert their currency to XRP, send that XRP to the destination
bank or instituion, and that buisness can convert XRP to their native currency, making it much simpler
and smoother than the process used in SWIFT. Since XRP transfers happen within seconds, banks do not have to worry about the volitility of the token
since they can quickly recieve and convert the token to whichever currency need, as soon as they recieve the tokens.

As smooth as that sounds, there was an issue however with the XRP token and these instuitions.
In the past, instituions that wanted to use this system had to hold the XRP token, however this harmed 
instuitions due to XRPs extreme voilitility and regulations issues. However, now Ripple allows these
instuitions to use the XRP token for transactions without holding any XRP in their balance sheets and
Ripple continues to work with governments to comply with regulations.



## Results

As of recently, Ripple has many banks and instituitions using their products and the XRP token has grown significantly
in value. However, they are facing some serious charges with the SEC, and as a result the XRP token has
been removed from several exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance US. Even with this allegations, 
many people especially in the XRP community have hope that Ripple will make it through this case. 
Despite the XRP token being off many exchanges for several months now, the price of the token has still
continued to increase in value and remains to be on of the top 10 cryptocurrencies in the market. 

Overall Ripple and XRP show great promise and does have a solution for a very serious financial problem.
It should still be noted that Ripple is a very controversial company due to their current case with the 
SEC and the fact that they hold so much of the XRP token as mentioned earlier. Many people in the cryptocurrency
community criticize Ripple for being centralized due to the fact they hold so much XRP tokens,
which some may say goes against the whole concept of decentralization that cryptocurrency community strongly believes in.

Nevertheless, we can not ignore the fact that Ripple has a very clear goal and is very focused on achieving their goal.
They also have a good product that works, and they have a solution for a very serious problem, which shows 
they have good promise and potential to succeed.
