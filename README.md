## Overview and Origin

Ripple is a company that uses blockchain technology and cryptocurrency (XRP) to process international payments in a much easier and efficient manner. 
It was first thought of by Jeb McCaleb and built by Arthur Britto and David Schwartz (current Chief Technology Officer) in 2005. It was then released 
in 2012 and by 2013 they claimed that many banks were interested in the project. Currently over 300 financial institutions are using RippleNet, 
including Bank of America, Santander Bank, and American Express. They have had $150 million plus donations since 2018. They also have investors from 
capital firms and strategic investors. However, many people argue that their main source of income comes from the XRP token, since Ripple owns about 
50% of the cryptocurrency.



## Business Activities:

Ripple is trying to solve a major problem in the space of finance right now. International payments currently are very slow and costly. 
Most payments go through SWIFT, a messaging network used by banks to transfer information, such as money transfer instructions. Payments 
that go through SWIFT often have to go through multiple banks because of the many different currencies involved. For example, if business 
A wants to send YEN to business B, which uses Mexican PESOS, the YEN will have to be converted through multiple banks in search of currency 
conversions (because most likely business A with YEN does not have Mexican PESOS and vice versa)
which costs money in fees and time. These payments also take several days to settle, which means more time wasted and if the payments 
are not settled for whatever reason, they can be reversed or cancelled.

Ripple offers to solve this problem with their RippleNet protocol and their cryptocurrency XRP. RippleNet allows banks to transfer information 
much quicker and cheaper than SWIFT. They also allow banks to issue IOU's to each other. An IOU is simply a debt that one bank owes to another. 
However, the real magic happens with the XRP token. With XRP, banks can now transfer value and settle transactions in real time and at very low costs, 
as opposed to SWIFT which can take days to settle transactions and is very costly. XRP can process over 1000 transactions per second and only costing 
fractions of a penny, as compared to other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which can only process about 8 transactions per second and ETH which can 
only process about 16 per second (currently ETH fees are ridiculous, some transactions costing over $100 in fees!). This makes XRP one of the fastest 
and cheapest to use tokens in the cryptocurrency market, also making it the most optimal for the specific use case of transferring payments. With the 
XRP token, banks can simply convert their currency to XRP, send that XRP to the destination bank or institution, and that business can convert XRP to 
their native currency, making it much simpler and smoother than the process used in SWIFT. Since XRP transfers happen within seconds, banks do not have 
to worry about the volatility of the token since they can quickly receive and convert the token to whichever currency they need, as soon as they receive 
the token.

As smooth as that sounds, there was an issue however with the XRP token and these institutions. In the past, institutions that wanted to use this system 
had to hold the XRP token, however this harmed institutions due to XRPs extreme volatility and regulations issues. However, now Ripple allows these 
institutions to use the XRP token for transactions without holding any XRP in their balance sheets and Ripple continues to work with governments to comply 
with regulations.




## Results

As of recently, Ripple has many banks and institutions using their products and the XRP token has grown significantly in value. However, they are facing some 
serious charges with the SEC, and as a result the XRP token has been removed from several exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance US. Even with these allegations, 
many people especially in the XRP community have hope that Ripple will make it through this case. Despite the XRP token being off many exchanges for several months now, 
the price of the token has still continued to increase in value and remains to be one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies in the market.

Overall Ripple and XRP show great promise and do have a solution for a very serious financial problem. It should still be noted that Ripple is a very controversial company 
due to their current case with the SEC and the fact that they hold so much of the XRP token as mentioned earlier. Many people in the cryptocurrency community criticize Ripple for being centralized due to the fact they hold so many XRP tokens, which some may say goes against the whole concept of decentralization that the cryptocurrency community strongly believes in.

Nevertheless, we can not ignore the fact that Ripple has a very clear goal and is very focused on achieving their goal. They also have a good product that works, and they have 
a solution for a very serious problem, which shows they have good promise and potential to succeed.
